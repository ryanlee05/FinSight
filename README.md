## Notes

- [ ] I was very limited with the amount of API calls I can use for the free plan (100 per month), so I had to write and test very carefully.
- [ ] I have a passion for investing and trading stocks, so this was an enjoyable project to build and finish!
- [ ] I appreciate MarketStack for the free access to stock data through their API, as it was easy to access and full of information.
- [ ] FYI -> Because of the limited API calls, if the site does not work, it's because I used the limit :)
